         <p>Welcome to Biggest Fish! We are a community that have been sharing our love for fishing in the larger Miami area for over 5 years! What started off as a small forum
			on a deep corner of the internet,through a massive fundraiser have been able to relocate to a physical office for any in-person enquiries!</p>
         <p>On this website, you will find where we share our community's biggest catch of the day, as well as our full contact info, and also some merchandise!</p>
         <hr />
		 <p>We aim to be the biggest host of fishing and game competition in Florida. If you would like to organise or join a competition, please visit the respective section of our website!</p>
		 <hr />
		 <p>As Biggest Fish was originally a small group created on a free domain, we remain to be completely free for discussion and contribution to catch of the day. We also host a number
			of free competitions. Some competitions require a monetary entry fee.</p>
